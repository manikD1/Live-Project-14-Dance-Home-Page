## **🤔 What did I learn making this project ? 🤔**

- This project taught me how to rake my brain hard as this project involves clever designing skills, how to keep horizontal rules side by side as divs, then transform rotate them to vertically align them, use position properties to move them according to need and also create text effects by hiding certain text to create a broken text effect. But by now I had loads of practice doing previous projects that this one only took me under 3 hours to demolish.
